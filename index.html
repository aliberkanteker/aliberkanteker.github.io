        <h2>KAYSat Model Satellite Team</h2>
        <p>
            As a member of the KAYSat Model Satellite Team, established in September 2022, I am involved in the design and development processes in the field of model satellites. In my role as Team Captain, I support the team's overall coordination and project planning. As a team, we continue our work with an interdisciplinary approach, focusing on various projects like KAYSAT.

            <h3>CANSAT (Educational Project)</h3>
            <p>
                Our first project as the KAYSat team was to develop a CANSAT, a model satellite the size of a soda can. Through this project, we gained valuable experience in collecting basic sensor data, transmitting it via telemetry, and processing this data. In this work, as Team Captain, I took part in coordinating the integration of electronic systems and the software development processes.

            <h3>KAYSAT (Teknofest Model Satellite Competition)</h3>
            <p>
                KAYSAT is a model satellite we developed for the TEKNOFEST 2023 Model Satellite Competition, designed to perform autonomous tasks according to the competition's requirements. In this project, alongside my responsibility as Team Captain, I also served as the Electrical Subsystem Designer. This process provided an opportunity to apply our theoretical knowledge in a competitive environment and to create a product as a team.
