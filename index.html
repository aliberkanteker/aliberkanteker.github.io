        <h1>Hello, I'm Ali Berkant Eker üëã</h1>
        <p class="intro-text">As a master's student in Astronomy and Space Sciences at Erciyes University, I conduct research and develop various projects in the fields of embedded systems, telemetry, and satellite technologies. I also serve as the Team Captain of the KAYSat Model Satellite Team, working together with my teammates to bring our projects to life.</p>

        <h2>KAYSat Model Satellite Team</h2>
        <p>
            As one of the founding members of the KAYSat Model Satellite Team, established in September 2022 under the leadership of our advisor, I have been actively involved since the project's inception. Currently, as Team Captain, I support the team's coordination and project planning. Furthermore, I contributed to the creation process of the "CubeSats and Space Technologies" course opened by my advisor, and I now serve as a co-instructor for its practical technical training sessions. As a team, we continue our work with an interdisciplinary approach.

            <h2>CANSAT (Educational Project)</h2>
            <p>
                Our first project as the KAYSat team was to develop a CANSAT, a model satellite the size of a soda can. Through this project, we gained valuable experience in collecting basic sensor data, transmitting it via telemetry, and processing this data. In this work, as Team Captain, I took part in coordinating the integration of electronic systems and the software development processes.

            <h3>KAYSAT (Teknofest Model Satellite Competition)</h3>
            <p>
                KAYSAT is a model satellite we developed for the TEKNOFEST 2023 Model Satellite Competition, designed to perform autonomous tasks according to the competition's requirements. In this project, alongside my responsibility as Team Captain, I also served as the Electrical Subsystem Designer. This process provided an opportunity to apply our theoretical knowledge in a competitive environment and to create a product as a team.

        <h2>NOCTUS-06 Functional CubeSat and Ground Station Platform</h2>
        <p><em>Developed by: Ali Berkant Eker</em></p>
        
        <h3>Project Purpose</h3>
        <p>
            NOCTUS-06 is a ground-based CubeSat prototype, designed in a 1U format, that collects atmospheric data (temperature, pressure, humidity, CO2, methane, etc.) and transmits this data instantly to a ground station via RF telemetry. This project was undertaken to demonstrate the capabilities for developing low-cost satellite systems and data acquisition platforms.
        </p>

        <h3>Technical Specifications</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Sensors:</strong> BME280 (Temperature, Pressure, Humidity), MH-Z19 (CO2), MQ-4 (Methane), MQ-9 (Propane), MPU6050 (3-Axis Gyro & Accelerometer)</li>
            <li><strong>Positioning:</strong> GY-NEO6MV2 GPS Module</li>
            <li><strong>Processor:</strong> Arduino Mega 2560 Pro Mini</li>
            <li><strong>Communication:</strong> RF900 Ultra Long Range Radio Modem (Telemetry)</li>
            <li><strong>Power:</strong> 2x 18650 Li-ion Battery (7.4V), 5V DC-DC Converter</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Core Platform Capabilities</h3>
        <ul class="capabilities-list">
            <li>
                <strong>üõ∞Ô∏è CubeSat (NOCTUS-06):</strong> Within the 1U chassis, which I personally designed and 3D modeled using SolidWorks, it precisely measures critical data once per second, such as temperature, humidity, pressure, carbon dioxide (CO2), various gases (methane & propane), 3-axis acceleration & gyroscope, GPS position, and system current.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>üì° Real-Time Data Stream:</strong> All telemetry data collected from the satellite is packaged in JSON format and transmitted instantly to the ground station via RF telemetry modules.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>üñ•Ô∏è Desktop User Interface (GUI):</strong> The desktop GUI application, which I developed using Electron.js and Flask (Python), visualizes incoming live data in a modern and user-friendly interface, displays the satellite's position on a map, and presents sensor data with real-time graphs.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>üíæ Dual-Layer Data Storage:</strong> For reliability and data integrity, I established a dual-layer storage architecture. All telemetry data is saved both to the onboard SD card in CSV format and simultaneously stored in the cloud on Firebase.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Conclusion and Learnings</h3>
        <p>
            This project has provided practical experience in embedded systems programming, sensor integration, power management, and wireless communication. The successful real-time transfer of data in JSON format to a Flask and Electron-based interface demonstrates a complete system integration.
