        <h2>KAYSat Model Satellite Team</h2>
        <p>
            As one of the founding members of the KAYSat Model Satellite Team, established in September 2022 under the leadership of our advisor, I have been actively involved since the project's inception. Currently, as Team Captain, I support the team's coordination and project planning. Furthermore, I contributed to the creation process of the "CubeSats and Space Technologies" course opened by my advisor, and I now serve as a co-instructor for its practical technical training sessions. As a team, we continue our work with an interdisciplinary approach.

            <h3>CANSAT (Educational Project)</h3>
            <p>
                Our first project as the KAYSat team was to develop a CANSAT, a model satellite the size of a soda can. Through this project, we gained valuable experience in collecting basic sensor data, transmitting it via telemetry, and processing this data. In this work, as Team Captain, I took part in coordinating the integration of electronic systems and the software development processes.

            <p>
                This hands-on project was a crucial first step for our team, establishing a strong foundation in satellite subsystems and mission operations. The experience gained here directly paved the way for our more advanced entry into the Teknofest competition.

                        During the CANSAT project's development, we successfully handled the technical integration and verified our prototype's functionality through various tests. We shared these successful results with the academic community through presentations at relevant departments in our university. These presentations offered a valuable opportunity to introduce our project to a wider audience and receive feedback. The insights gained from this feedback were highly constructive, reinforcing our design choices while also highlighting areas for improvement. Ultimately, the confidence and the technical skills honed during the CANSAT development were instrumental in our decision to take on the more ambitious KAYSAT project for the Teknofest competition.

            <h3>KAYSAT KAYSAT Model Satellite and Carrier System <br> (Teknofest Model Satellite Competition)</h3>
            <p>
                KAYSAT is a model satellite we developed for the TEKNOFEST 2023 Model Satellite Competition, designed to perform autonomous tasks according to the competition's requirements. In this project, alongside my responsibility as Team Captain, I also served as the Electrical Subsystem Designer. This process provided an opportunity to apply our theoretical knowledge in a competitive environment and to create a product as a team.

                    <p>
                        NOCTUS-06 is a ground-based CubeSat prototype, designed in a 1U format, that collects atmospheric data (temperature, pressure, humidity, CO2, methane, etc.) and transmits this data instantly to a ground station via RF telemetry. This project was undertaken to demonstrate the capabilities for developing low-cost satellite systems and data acquisition platforms.
